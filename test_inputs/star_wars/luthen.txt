Calm
Kindness, Kinship
Love
I’ve given up all chance at inner peace
I made my mind a sunless place
I share my dreams with ghosts
I wake up every day to an equation I wrote 15 years ago, from which there’s only one conclusion
I’m damned for what I do
My anger, my ego, my unwillingness to yield, my eagerness to fight
They’ve set me on a path from which there is no escape
I yearned to be a savior against injustice without contemplating the cost and by the time I looked down, there was no longer any ground beneath my feet
What’s my sacrifice?
I’m condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them
I burn my decency for someone else’s future
I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I’ll never see
And the ego that started this fight will never have a mirror, or an audience or the light of gratitude
So what do I sacrifice
EVERYTHING
So you’ll stay with me Lonni
I need all the heroes I can get
